<p>If you’re an immigrant living in California, here is what you need to know to protect yourself, your family, and your community from coronavirus. Services and public benefits are available to you, some regardless of immigration status. </p>



<h2>COVID-19 and the public charge rule</h2>



<p>Effective July 29, 2020, a federal court ruling prohibits the application and enforcement of this new public charge rule in Connecticut, New York, and Vermont. However, the policy may be applied in California, although the federal government has not released additional guidance and this may change. Please visit the <a href="https://www.uscis.gov/green-card/green-card-processes-and-procedures/public-charge">US Citizenship &amp; Immigration Services (USCIS) website</a> for updated information.</p>



<p>If you have questions about your specific case, please <a href="https://www.cdss.ca.gov/benefits-services/more-services/immigration-services/immigration-services-contractors/public-charge-contact-list">consult qualified immigration assistance</a>.</p>



<h2>Testing and treatment</h2>



<p><strong><strong>Don’t let fear stop you from getting necessary treatment</strong>, </strong>as the effects of avoiding health care services may be very serious. This will help keep you, your family, and your community healthy.</p>



<p>If you’re undocumented or don’t have insurance, you can still get needed COVID-19 testing and treatment at no cost. Medi-cal care for COVID-19 related testing or treatment alone DOES NOT count under the public charge rule.</p>



<p>See <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/testing-and-treatment/">who can get tested</a>.</p>



<h4><strong><strong>Uninsured? Have Medi-Cal, but no regular doctor? Call Medi-Nurse</strong></strong></h4>



<p>Medi-Nurse is a <a href="https://www.dhcs.ca.gov/Pages/DHCS-COVID%E2%80%9119-Medi-Nurse-Line.aspx">free, 24/7 nurse advice line</a> available at <a href="about:blank">1-877-409-9052</a>. You can speak directly with a health professional about your symptoms, get advice for further treatment in your area, or ask how to apply for health insurance.</p>

<h2>Avoid utility power shut-offs</h2>



<p>Many utility companies are not shutting off services due to non-payment.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>The Water Board restricts shut off to water services during the COVID-19 crisis. Please fill out this <a href="https://watershut-off.covid19.ca.gov/">form </a>to report any water shut off or reconnection issue.

<p>Eligible Californians received one-time COVID-19 disaster relief assistance at a value of $500. Here’s <a href="https://www.cdss.ca.gov/Portals/9/Immigration/COVID/DRAI-Allocations-81720.pdf">how the funds were distributed (PDF)</a>.</p>
