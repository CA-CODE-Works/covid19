<h2 id="holiday-tips">Tips for a healthier holiday season</h2>



<p>The spread of COVID-19 is increasing across the country and in California as colder weather drives more people indoors. To keep yourself and your loved ones safe, follow the <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/Guidance-for-the-Prevention-of-COVID-19-Transmission-for-Gatherings-November-2020.aspx">guidelines for small gatherings</a>. Here are some extra tips on how to celebrate the holidays more safely.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Check <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/safer-economy/">your county’s tier status</a></strong> to find out what types of activities and gatherings are permitted in your county based on the current spread of the virus.</li><li><strong>Wear a mask when you leave home</strong>, including on public and mass transportation, at events and gatherings, shopping and in stores, and anywhere you will be around people who do not live with you.</li><li><strong>Wear a mask</strong> not only with people you do not know, but <strong>with anyone you don’t live with</strong> including close friends and family.</li><li><strong>Keep your distance</strong> – especially from older family members and those with chronic health conditions.</li><li><strong>Do not gather indoors with other households</strong> if your county prohibits it.</li><li>If you are in a county where indoor gathering is permitted, when indoors, <strong>keep windows and doors open</strong> so fresh air circulates and wear a mask.</li><li>If you are in a county where indoor gathering is permitted, use all the space you can indoors; <strong>spread things out</strong>.</li><li><strong>Don’t share utensils or drinks</strong> with anyone. </li><li><strong>Commit to keeping gatherings short</strong>, whether inside or outside. Shorter (two hours or less) is safer.</li><li><strong>People at higher risk</strong> of severe illness or death from COVID-19 (such as older adults and people with chronic medical conditions) <strong>are strongly urged not to attend</strong> any gatherings, especially indoor gatherings. If you gather with older people or those with chronic conditions, make sure they wear a surgical or N95 mask.</li><li>It is safest to celebrate the holidays with the people who already live with you, but if you invite others,<strong> only invite a maximum of two other households</strong> to your gathering. </li><li>Travel increases your chance of getting and spreading the virus. <strong>Incoming travelers from out of state should self-quarantine for 14 days </strong>after arrival before mixing indoors with others. </li><li><strong>Wash your hands</strong> often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or use hand sanitizer. Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth. </li><li><strong>Stay home if you are sick.</strong></li></ul>
