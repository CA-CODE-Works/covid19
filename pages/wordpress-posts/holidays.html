<p>Holidays usually mean gathering with friends and extended family, attending parties, hosting dinners, traveling, and celebrating time-honored customs. But some holiday activities promote congregating and mixing of households, which increase the risk of transmitting COVID-19.</p>



<p>Enjoy your holidays safely. Follow guidance from the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) and plan safe, alternative celebrations that don’t spread coronavirus in your community.</p>



<h2>Halloween</h2>



<p><strong>Trick-or-treating is strongly discouraged. </strong>It involves face-to-face interactions of people from different households, which can increase the spread of COVID-19. Also, if infection is detected after trick-or-treating, it would be very difficult to find and notify those that may have been exposed.</p>



<p>Plan lower-risk celebrations instead, like:</p>



<ul><li>Having fun at home with scary movies, a candy scavenger hunt, or turning your home into a haunted house</li><li>Joining online parties for costume contests or pumpkin carving</li><li>Enjoying activities from your car like drive-through Halloween displays or drive-in movies</li><li>Dressing up your home or yard with Halloween decorations</li></ul>

<h2>Día de los Muertos</h2>



<p>For safety, celebrate Día de los Muertos only with other members of your household, or online.</p>



<p>Some low-risk activities are:</p>



<ul><li>Placing altars outside or in a front-facing window so they can be seen from a distance</li><li>Creating virtual altars online that can be shared through email or social media</li><li>Visiting cemeteries only with your household. Wear masks and physically distance from others. Limit time you spend there.</li></ul>
