<p>Holidays usually mean gathering with friends and extended family, attending parties, hosting dinners, traveling, and celebrating time-honored customs. But some holiday activities promote congregating and mixing of households, which increase the risk of transmitting COVID-19.</p>



<p>Enjoy your holidays safely. Follow guidance from the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) and plan safer, alternative celebrations that don’t spread coronavirus to your family and in your community.</p>



<h2>Halloween</h2>



<p>Plan lower-risk celebrations, like:</p>



<ul><li>Playing a game at home like <a href="http://files.covid19.ca.gov/pdf/Halloween_Hoopla_PRINTOUT.pdf">Halloween Hoopla!</a></li></ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="http://files.covid19.ca.gov/pdf/Halloween_Hoopla_PRINTOUT.pdf"><img src="http://files.covid19.ca.gov/img/Halloween_Hoopla_rect.png" alt=""/></a></figure>



<ul><li>Joining online parties for costume contests or pumpkin carving</li><li>Enjoying activities from your car like drive-through Halloween displays or drive-in movies</li><li>Having fun at home with scary movies, a candy scavenger hunt, or turning your home into a haunted house</li><li>Putting on costumes and going on a physically distanced walk with your household</li><li>Dressing up your home or yard with Halloween decorations</li></ul>



<p>Many traditional Halloween celebrations – such as parties and in-person,  door to door trick-or-treating – pose a high risk of spreading COVID-19 and could put your family and loved ones at risk. These activities involve face to face interactions with people from different households, and if an infection is detected among a participant, it will be very difficult to find and notify those who may have been exposed.</p>



<p>For more low-risk Halloween activities, read CDPH’s <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/Guidance-for-Safer-Halloween-and-Dia-de-los-Muertos-Celebrations-during-COVID-19.aspx">Guidance for Safer Halloween and Dia de los Muertos Celebrations during COVID-19</a>.</p>



<h2>Día de los Muertos</h2>



<p>For safety, celebrate Día de los Muertos only with other members of your household, or online.</p>



<p>Some low-risk activities are:</p>



<ul><li>Placing altars outside or in a front-facing window so they can be seen from a distance</li><li>Creating virtual altars online that can be shared through email or social media</li><li>Creating altar cards that can be sent in the mail</li><li>Visiting cemeteries only with your household. Wear masks and physically distance from others. Limit time you spend there.</li></ul>

<p>Your local health department may have additional restrictions. Check your <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/get-local-information/#County-websites">county’s COVID-19 website</a> for information about Halloween and Día de los Muertos in your community.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Questions and answers</h2>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Has the state released any guidance yet for Thanksgiving, Hanukkah, Christmas, or New Year&#8217;s Eve?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">No, but that guidance is in progress. We know that the weather is colder and people miss friends and family, but there are surging case rates and COVID-19 hospitalizations across the country, and flu season is underway, making holiday activities particularly risky.</p>
