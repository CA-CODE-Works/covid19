<p>Holidays usually mean gathering with friends and extended family, attending parties, hosting dinners, traveling, and celebrating time-honored customs. But some holiday activities promote congregating and mixing of households, which increase the risk of transmitting COVID-19.</p>



<p>Enjoy your holidays safely. Follow guidance from the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) and plan safer celebrations for Thanksgiving, Christmas, Hanukkah, Kwanzaa, and New Year’s Eve.</p>



<h2>Tips for a healthier holiday season</h2>



<p>The spread of COVID-19 is increasing across the country and in California as colder weather drives more people indoors. To keep yourself and your loved ones safe, follow the [<a href="http://link">guidelines for small gatherings</a>]. Here are some extra tips on how to celebrate the holidays more safely.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Check your county’s tier status</strong> to find out what types of activities and gatherings are permitted in your county based on the current spread of the virus.</li><li><strong>Wear a mask in public settings</strong>, like on public and mass transportation, at events and gatherings, shopping and in stores, and anywhere you will be around people who do not live with you.</li><li><strong>Wear a mask</strong> not only with people you do not know, but <strong>with anyone you don’t live with</strong> including close friends and family.</li><li><strong>Keep your distance</strong> – especially from older family members and those with chronic health conditions.</li><li><strong>Do not gather indoors with other households</strong> if your county prohibits it.</li><li>If you are in a county where indoor gathering is permitted, when indoors, <strong>keep windows and doors open</strong> so fresh air circulates and wear a mask.</li><li>If you are in a county where indoor gathering is permitted, use all the space you can indoors; <strong>spread things out</strong>.</li><li><strong>Don’t share utensils or drinks</strong> with anyone. </li><li><strong>Commit to keeping gatherings short</strong>, whether inside or outside. Shorter is safer.</li><li><strong>People at higher risk</strong> of severe illness or death from COVID-19 (such as older adults and people with chronic medical conditions) <strong>are strongly urged not to attend</strong> any gatherings, especially indoor gatherings. If you gather with older people or those with chronic conditions, make sure they wear a surgical or N95 mask.</li><li>It is safest to celebrate the holidays with the people who already live with you, but if you invite others,<strong> only invite a maximum of two other households</strong> to your gathering. </li><li>Travel increases your chance of getting and spreading the virus. <strong>Incoming travelers from out of state should self-quarantine for 14 days </strong>after arrival before mixing indoors with others. </li><li><strong>Wash your hands</strong> often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or use hand sanitizer. Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth. </li><li><strong>Stay home if you are sick.</strong></li></ul>

<p class="wp-accordion-content">Plan lower-risk celebrations, like:</p>



<ul class="wp-accordion-content"><li>Playing a game at home like <a href="http://files.covid19.ca.gov/pdf/Halloween_Hoopla_PRINTOUT.pdf">Halloween Hoopla!</a></li></ul>

<ul class="wp-accordion-content"><li>Joining online parties for costume contests or pumpkin carving</li><li>Enjoying activities from your car like drive-through Halloween displays or drive-in movies</li><li>Having fun at home with scary movies, a candy scavenger hunt, or turning your home into a haunted house</li><li>Putting on costumes and going on a physically distanced walk with your household</li><li>Dressing up your home or yard with Halloween decorations</li></ul>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Many traditional Halloween celebrations – such as parties and in-person,  door to door trick-or-treating – pose a high risk of spreading COVID-19 and could put your family and loved ones at risk. These activities involve face to face interactions with people from different households, and if an infection is detected among a participant, it will be very difficult to find and notify those who may have been exposed.</p>
