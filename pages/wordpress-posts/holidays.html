<p>Holidays usually mean gathering with friends and extended family, attending parties, hosting dinners, traveling, and celebrating time-honored customs. But some holiday activities promote congregating and mixing of households, which increase the risk of transmitting COVID-19.</p>



<p>Enjoy your holidays safely. Follow guidance from the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) and plan safer, alternative celebrations that don’t spread coronavirus to your family and in your community.</p>



<h2>Halloween</h2>



<p>Plan lower-risk celebrations, like:</p>



<ul><li>Joining online parties for costume contests or pumpkin carving</li><li>Enjoying activities from your car like drive-through Halloween displays or drive-in movies</li><li>Having fun at home with scary movies, a candy scavenger hunt, or turning your home into a haunted house</li><li>Put on costumes and go on a physically distanced walk with your household</li><li>Dressing up your home or yard with Halloween decorations</li></ul>



<p>Many traditional Halloween celebrations – such as parties and in-person,<br>door to door trick-or-treating – pose a high risk of spreading COVID-19<br>and could put your family and loved ones at risk. These activities involve<br>face to face interactions with people from different households, and if an<br>infection is detected among a participant, it will be very difficult to find<br>and notify those who may have been exposed.</p>



<p>For more safe Halloween activities, read CDPH’s <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/Guidance-for-Safer-Halloween-and-Dia-de-los-Muertos-Celebrations-during-COVID-19.aspx">Guidance for Safer Halloween and Dia de los Muertos Celebrations during COVID-19</a>.</p>



<h2>Día de los Muertos</h2>



<p>For safety, celebrate Día de los Muertos only with other members of your household, or online.</p>



<p>Some low-risk activities are:</p>



<ul><li>Placing altars outside or in a front-facing window so they can be seen from a distance</li><li>Creating virtual altars online that can be shared through email or social media</li><li>Creating altar cards that can be sent in the mail</li><li>Visiting cemeteries only with your household. Wear masks and physically distance from others. Limit time you spend there.</li></ul>
