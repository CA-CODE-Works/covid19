<p><strong><strong><strong>Housing for the Harvest</strong> </strong></strong>is a new program that will offer temporary hotel housing to agricultural workers who need to isolate due to COVID-19. It will help positive or exposed workers protect their loved ones and coworkers by giving them a space to self-isolate.</p>



<p>Farm and food processing workers play an essential role in maintaining our food supply. But some who need to self-isolate are finding it difficult due to their housing situation.</p>



<h2>How does the program work?&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>



<p>The State will book hotel rooms in participating counties for workers who need to self-isolate for up to 14 days. The State will coordinate with local administrators who manage the program.</p>



<p>Locally-funded administrators will:</p>



<ul><li>Serve as primary point of contact with workers who need isolation housing&nbsp;</li><li>Verify participant eligibility</li><li>Coordinate with the State to book rooms</li><li>Provide services at the hotel site including transportation, meals and wellness checks</li><li>Ensure services are provided in the participant&#8217;s language, and</li><li>Collect data required for FEMA reimbursement.</li></ul>



<p>Local administrators will be identified in coordination with the State government. They may be a county or city agency, tribe, non-profit organization, or a philanthropic organization.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Who qualifies?&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Participants must meet these criteria:</p>



<ul><li>Work in California food processing or agriculture&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Meet <a href="https://www.cdss.ca.gov/Portals/9/FEMA/202005-DR-4482-CA-Non-Congregate-Sheltering-Request-Response-Letter-03272020.pdf">FEMA non-congregate sheltering criteria (PDF)</a> for COVID-19:&nbsp;<ul><li>Have tested positive, or&nbsp;</li><li>Been exposed as documented by a public health official or medical health professional</li></ul></li><li>Be unable to self-isolate at home&nbsp;</li></ul>
