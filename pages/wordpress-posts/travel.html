<h2 id="why-travel-is-risky">Why travel is risky</h2>



<p>When you travel, you live outside your home and come into contact with people outside your household. You are near new people in airports, train stations, gas stations, grocery stores, restaurants, hotels, short-term rentals, sightseeing attractions, and retail stores. These new people may be exposing you to COVID-19, or you may be unknowingly exposing them. People arriving in California from other states or Californians returning from other states or countries could also introduce new sources of infection (potentially including new strains of the coronavirus) to California. This contributes to community spread of the disease, which leads to more illness and death. </p>



<p>Hospitals in our state are critically low in available ICU beds, so it’s important that we do all we can to take fewer risks and not spread COVID-19.</p>



<p>Postponing travel and staying home is the best way to protect yourself and others from COVID-19.</p>

<h2 id="whats-considered-essential-travel">What&#8217;s considered essential travel</h2>



<p>Some travel is considered essential and necessary. Essential travel is that which supports work in:</p>



<ul><li>Critical infrastructure (like the water supply or power grid)</li><li>Economic services (like banking)</li><li>Supply chains (like food distribution)</li><li>Health care and immediate medical care</li><li>Safety and security</li></ul>



<h2 id="current-travel-recommendations">Current travel recommendations</h2>



<p>Californians must remain local (not traveling more than 120 miles from their home or other place of residence) and avoid non-essential travel. Travelers from other states or countries entering into California for tourism and recreation are strongly discouraged.</p>



<p>Currently, California restricts the following statewide:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Hotels and short-term rentals</strong> (including any reservations made through third-party venues and platforms)<ul><li>May only accept reservations if the traveler attests to the fact that they are traveling for essential services.</li><li>May accept reservations if the traveler is using the lodging in connection with COVID-19 mitigation, containment, and treatment measures, as accommodation for essential workers or those displaced by fire or other emergency, or for individuals or families who have no other primary residence (including individuals who would otherwise experience homelessness).</li></ul></li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Campgrounds</strong> <ul><li>Closed except for use in connection with COVID-19 mitigation, containment, and treatment measures, as accommodation for essential workers or those displaced by fire or other emergency, or for individuals or families who have no other primary residence (including individuals who would otherwise experience homelessness).</li></ul></li></ul>



<h2 id="questions-and-answers">Questions and answers</h2>



<h4 class="wp-accordion"><strong>I’m planning to travel in California. Where can I stay?</strong></h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">If you are traveling from out-of-state, and there is at least one region in California that is under a Regional Stay Home Order, no hotel or lodging in California (including those booked through services like AirBnB and VRBO) can accept or honor your reservation for non-essential travel, unless the reservation is for at least the minimum time period required for quarantine, and the persons identified in the reservation will quarantine in the hotel or lodging until after that time period has expired.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">If you are traveling in-state, hotels and lodgings in a county under a Regional Stay Home Order cannot accept or honor your reservation for non-essential travel.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Essential travel is that which supports:</p>



<ul class="wp-accordion-content"><li>Critical infrastructure (like the water supply or power grid)</li><li>Economic services (like banking)</li><li>Supply chains (like food distribution)</li><li>Health care and immediate medical care</li><li>Safety and security</li></ul>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Hotels or other commercial and residential buildings may only offer lodging for essential functions, including COVID-19 mitigation and containment measures, treatment measures, accommodation for essential workers, or housing solutions, including measures to protect homeless populations. If you are arriving in or returning to California from other states or countries, you should <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/CDPH%20Document%20Library/COVID-19/CDPH-Home-Quarantine-Guidance_9-16-2020.pdf">self-quarantine</a> for 10 days after arrival. Limit your interactions to those of your immediate household and do not mix with others outside of those necessary to conduct your essential work. This recommendation does not apply to individuals who routinely cross state or country borders for essential travel. Please see the California Department of Public Health’s <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/Travel-Advisory.aspx">Travel Advisory</a> for more information.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion"><strong>How does the Regional Stay Home </strong>O<strong>rder impact travel?</strong></h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">The Regional Stay Home Order instructs Californians to stay at home as much as possible and to stop the mixing between households that can lead to COVID-19 spread.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">You may still commute to work if you are an <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/essential-workforce/">Essential Critical Infrastructure Worker</a>, and there are a wide range of circumstances in which you may leave your home or other place of residence, even if you are not an Essential Critical Infrastructure Worker. For example, you may leave your home to work at any business or other entity that is allowed to open, to engage in in-person worship and protest activities consistent with public health directives, to patronize local businesses that are open, or to care for friends or family members who require assistance. (See details about caregiving under <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/healthcare/#helping-family-or-friends">Healthcare and coverage</a>.)</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Californians must also avoid non-essential travel. Avoiding travel altogether will reduce the risk of spreading the virus, including reducing the risk that new sources of infection (and, potentially, new virus strains) might be introduced to California. See the California Department of Public Health’s <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/Travel-Advisory.aspx">Travel Advisory</a> for more info.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Are there travel restrictions within California?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">On January 6, 2021, the California Department of Public Health issued a revised <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/Travel-Advisory.aspx">Travel Advisory</a> that supersedes the previous Travel Advisory issued on November 13, 2020. This new advisory affects all counties in California, whether they are under a Regional Stay Home Order or not. </p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">To prevent further spread of COVID-19 and help contain any new sources of infection, Californians must stay in their local area (which, for this purpose, means remaining within 120 miles from one’s home or other place of residence), unless they are traveling for essential purposes. Essential travel includes: work and study, critical infrastructure support, economic services and supply chains, health, immediate medical care, and safety and security.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Traveling into California from other states or countries for tourism or recreation is also strongly discouraged, and anyone traveling into California should self-quarantine for 10 days, unless quarantining is impracticable and the travel is for the sole purpose of meeting critical healthcare needs or other emergency response.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See the California Department of Public Health’s <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/Travel-Advisory.aspx">Travel Advisory</a> for more info.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Under a Regional Stay Home Order, should hotels, vacation rentals, and short-term lodging sites accept reservations?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">In any California region that is not under a Regional Stay Home Order, no hotel or lodging entity in California should accept out-of-state reservations for non-essential travel, unless the reservation is for at least the minimum time period required for quarantine and the persons identified in the reservation will quarantine in the hotel or lodging entity until after that time period has expired.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Additionally, hotels and lodging entities in a county under a Regional Stay Home Order should not accept reservations for non-essential travel, whether in-state or out-of-state.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">All hotels or other commercial and residential buildings may offer lodging for essential functions and travel including COVID-19 mitigation and containment measures, treatment measures, accommodation for essential workers or those displaced by fire or other emergency, or housing solutions, including measures to protect homeless populations.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion"><strong>Do I need to self-quarantine when I arrive in California?</strong></h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Travelers entering into California for tourism and recreation are strongly discouraged. If you do travel into California, you will need to <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/CDPH%20Document%20Library/COVID-19/CDPH-Home-Quarantine-Guidance_9-16-2020.pdf">self-quarantine</a> for 10 days after you arrive, and should limit your interactions to those in your household. If you are traveling into California for essential purposes, you should still self-quarantine for 10 days and ensure you do not mix with others outside of those necessary to conduct your essential work. The only exception to the quarantine period is if you are in California to meet urgent critical healthcare needs or any other emergent response. In these cases, strictly adhere to <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/guidance-for-face-coverings.aspx">face coverings</a> and physical distancing guidelines. </p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">If you routinely cross state or country borders for essential travel, and self-quarantine is impractical, you must still comply with all required guidance related to <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/guidance-for-face-coverings.aspx">face coverings</a> and physical distancing to reduce the risk of spread of the virus.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Can I visit State Parks? What outdoor spaces are open?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Outdoor spaces, including state parks, <strong>may </strong>be open to facilitate physically distanced personal health and wellness through outdoor exercise. However, be sure to check the status of parks in your area before you travel as some State parks may continue to be closed to help slow the spread of the virus.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">For information on National Parks, please the <a href="https://www.nps.gov/aboutus/news/public-health-update.htm">National Park Service website</a>.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Campgrounds located in counties that are under a Regional Stay at Home Order must be closed for overnight stays unless they are being used for COVID-19 mitigation and containment measures, treatment measures, providing accommodation for essential workers or those displaced as a result of fire or other emergency, or providing housing solutions, including measures to protect homeless populations.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content"><a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/industry-guidance/#campgrounds-outdoor-recreation">Outdoor playgrounds</a> may also be open if they are free to enter and use and primarily serve nearby residents. Your local health department may have additional restrictions. Check <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/get-local-information/#County-websites">your county’s COVID-19 website</a> for information on playgrounds in your community.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Californians must not travel significant distances (more than 120 miles from their home) for pleasure or recreation and should stay close to home. If you do travel, take steps to keep everyone safe like wearing a face covering, keeping 6 feet of physical distance from those not in your household, and washing your hands frequently.</p>
