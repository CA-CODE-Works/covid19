<h2 id="why-travel-is-risky">Why travel is risky</h2>



<p>When you travel, you live outside your home and come into contact with people outside your household. You are near new people in airports, train stations, gas stations, grocery stores, restaurants, hotels, short-term rentals, sightseeing attractions, and retail stores. These new people may be exposing you to COVID-19, or you may be unknowingly exposing them. This contributes to community spread of the disease, which leads to more illness and death.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Hospitals in our state are critically low in available ICU beds, so it’s important that we do all we can to take fewer risks and not spread COVID-19.</p>



<p>Stay close to home as much as possible. Do not travel more than 2 or 3 hours by car, unless travel is necessary to your essential job.</p>



<p>Read CDPH’s <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/Travel-Advisory.aspx">Travel Advisory</a> for more information.</p>



<h2 id="whats-considered-essential-travel">What&#8217;s considered essential travel</h2>



<p>Some travel is considered essential and necessary. Essential travel is that which supports:</p>



<ul><li>Critical infrastructure (like the water supply or power grid)</li><li>Economic services (like banking)</li><li>Supply chains (like food distribution)</li><li>Health care and immediate medical care</li><li>Safety and security</li></ul>



<p>Tourism or recreational travel is non-essential and should be avoided at this time.</p>



<h2 id="current-travel-restrictions">Current travel restrictions</h2>



<p>Some areas of the state are now under a Regional Stay Home Order. This order is triggered regionally when local hospitals are reaching full capacity. When any region of California is under a Regional Stay Home Order, travel in the whole state is affected.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Currently, California restricts the following statewide:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Hotels and short-term rentals</strong>&nbsp;<ul><li>Closed for non-essential in-state reservations</li><li>May only accept non-essential out-of-state reservations for a full period of quarantine</li></ul></li><li><strong>Campgrounds</strong>&nbsp;<ul><li>Closed except for use in COVID-19 treatment measures, accomodation of essential workers, emergency housing, and protecting homeless populations</li></ul></li></ul>



<h2 id="questions-and-answers">Questions and answers</h2>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Are there travel restrictions within California?</h4>

<h4 class="wp-accordion"><strong>How does the Regional Stay Home </strong>O<strong>rder impact travel?</strong></h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">The Regional Stay Home Order instructs Californians to stay at home as much as possible and to stop the mixing between households that can lead to COVID-19 spread.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">You may commute to work if you are an <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/essential-workforce/">Essential Critical Infrastructure Worker</a>. There are also a wide range of circumstances in which you may leave your home or other place of residence, even if you are not an Essential Critical Infrastructure Worker. For example, you may leave your home to work at any business or other entity that is allowed to open, to engage in in-person worship and protest activities consistent with public health directives, to patronize local businesses, or to care for friends or family members who require assistance. (See details about caregiving under <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/healthcare/#helping-family-or-friends">Health care and coverage</a>.)</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">In order to prevent further spread of COVID-19, Californians should not travel significant distances and should stay close to home as much as possible.

<h4 class="wp-accordion">Under a Regional Stay Home Order, can hotels, vacation rentals, and short-term lodging sites accept reservations?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">When any California region is under a Regional Stay Home Order, no hotel or lodging entity in California can accept or honor out-of-state reservations for non-essential travel, unless the reservation is for at least the minimum time period required for quarantine and the persons identified in the reservation will quarantine in the hotel or lodging entity until after that time period has expired.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Additionally, hotels and lodging entities in a county under a Regional Stay Home Order cannot accept or honor in-state reservations for non-essential travel.Hotels or other commercial and residential buildings may offer lodging for essential functions and travel including COVID-19 mitigation and containment measures, treatment measures, accommodation for essential workers or those displaced by fire or other emergency, or housing solutions, including measures to protect homeless populations.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Can I visit State Parks? What outdoor spaces are open?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Many of California’s public outdoor spaces and campgrounds may now <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/safer-economy">open in certain counties</a> with COVID-19 safety modifications. Starting June 12, some counties may open campgrounds and RV parks. Be sure to check parks in your area before you travel as some State Parks may continue to be closed to help slow the spread of the virus. Californians should not travel significant distances for pleasure or recreation and should stay close to home. If you do travel, take steps to keep everyone safe like wearing a face covering, keeping 6 feet of physical distance from those not in your household, and washing your hands frequently. See the California Department of Public Health’s <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/Travel-Advisory.aspx">Travel Advisory</a> for more info.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Campgrounds located in counties that are under a Regional Stay at Home Order must be closed for overnight stays unless they are being used for COVID-19 mitigation and containment measures, treatment measures, providing accommodation for essential workers or those displaced as a result of fire or other emergency, or providing housing solutions, including measures to protect homeless populations.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">You can still walk, run, hike, and bike in your local neighborhoods as long as they continue to practice physical distancing of 6 feet. This means avoiding crowded trails and parking lots.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content"><a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/industry-guidance/#campgrounds-outdoor-recreation">Outdoor playgrounds</a> may also open if they are free to enter and use and primarily serve nearby residents. Your local health department may have additional restrictions. Check <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/get-local-information/#County-websites">your county’s COVID-19 website</a> for information on playgrounds in your community.</p>
