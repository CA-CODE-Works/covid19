<p>Those who do not have federally-backed loans can contact their loan servicers to request forbearance. Your lender must provide detailed reasons if they deny your forbearance request. You can contest a denial.</p>

<h2>Questions and answers</h2>



<h2>Questions and answers on financial relief</h2>



<h4 class="wp-accordion"><strong>What effect will late payments have on my credit report?</strong></h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Financial institutions will not report derogatory information (like late payments) to credit reporting agencies but may report a forbearance. Typically this does not negatively affect a credit score on its own.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion"><strong>How long will financial relief programs last?</strong></h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">It is still unclear how severe or how long the COVID-19 impact will be. Financial institutions have committed to necessary relief and will be assessing the ongoing conditions and need for continuing relief.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion"><strong>What if my financial institution isn’t offering payment relief?</strong></h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Call or check their website to be sure. At this time, JP Morgan Chase, US Bank, Wells Fargo and Citigroup, <a href="https://dbo.ca.gov/covid19-updates-fi/">and nearly 200 state-chartered banks</a>, credit unions are supporting these commitments.&nbsp;</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion"><strong>Is mortgage relief available to businesses?</strong></h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">The relief is currently only available for residential mortgages.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion"><strong>What if my mortgage servicer is not communicative or cooperative?</strong></h4>
