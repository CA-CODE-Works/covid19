<h3>Eviction moratorium</h3>



<p>You cannot be evicted before February 1, 2021 if you owe rent due to a coronavirus-related hardship between March 4 – January 20, 2021. You must provide a declaration of hardship demonstrating your inability to pay. If you are unable to pay your rent due to a coronavirus-related hardship between September 1, 2020 – January 31, 2021, you must also pay at least 25 percent of the rent due to avoid eviction. Visit our <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/housing-and-homelessness/">housing page</a> to learn what your declaration should include.</p>



<p>Rent is still due and evictions can still occur. There may be additional local protections against eviction. Check with your county or city to find out. Renters in California who cannot pay their rent because of COVID-19-related hardships and should <a href="https://www.bcsh.ca.gov/coronavirus19/stabilization_act_guidance.pdf">know their rights</a>. Visit <a href="https://housingiskey.com/">Housing is Key</a> for more information.</p>



<h3>Mortgage relief&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Foreclosure protection is available for homeowners or small landlords who have federally-backed mortgages through the federal Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act.</p>



<p>Homeowners or small landlords who do not have federally-backed loans can contact their loan servicers to request forbearance. Your lender must provide detailed reasons if they deny your forbearance request. You can contest a denial.</p>

<h3>Avoiding utility shut-off</h3>



<p>Many utility providers are not shutting off services due to non-payment. Check with the <a href="https://www.cpuc.ca.gov/covid19protections/">California Public Utilities Commission</a> for more information.</p>



<p>The Water Board restricts the shut off of water during the COVID crisis. <a href="https://watershut-off.covid19.ca.gov/">Please use this form to report any water shutoff or reconnect issue</a>.</p>



<h3><strong>No credit score changes for accessing relief</strong></h3>



<p>If you are taking advantage of this COVID-19-related relief, late or missed payments will not be shared with credit reporting agencies.</p>

<h2>Questions and answers on financial relief</h2>



<h4 class="wp-accordion"><strong>What effect will late payments have on my credit report?</strong></h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Financial institutions will not report derogatory information (like late payments) to credit reporting agencies but may report a forbearance. Typically this does not negatively affect a credit score on its own.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion"><strong>How long will financial relief programs last?</strong></h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">It is still unclear how severe or how long the COVID-19 impact will be. Financial institutions have committed to necessary relief and will be assessing the ongoing conditions and need for continuing relief.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion"><strong>What if my financial institution isn’t offering payment relief?</strong></h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Call or check their website to be sure. At this time, JP Morgan Chase, US Bank, Wells Fargo and Citigroup, <a href="https://dbo.ca.gov/covid19-updates-fi/">and nearly 200 state-chartered banks</a>, credit unions are supporting these commitments.&nbsp;</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion"><strong>Is mortgage relief available to businesses?</strong></h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">The relief is currently only available for residential mortgages.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion"><strong>What if my mortgage servicer is not communicative or cooperative?</strong></h4>
