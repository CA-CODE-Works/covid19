<p>All individuals living in the State of California are currently ordered to stay home or at their place of residence, except for <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/safer-economy/">permitted work</a>, local shopping or other permitted errands, or as otherwise authorized (including in the Questions &amp; Answers below).</p>



<p>On March 19, 2020, an <a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/3.19.20-attested-EO-N-33-20-COVID-19-HEALTH-ORDER.pdf">Executive Order (PDF)</a> and <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/CDPH%20Document%20Library/COVID-19/Health%20Order%203.19.2020.pdf">Public Health Order (PDF)</a> directed all Californians to stay home except to go to an essential job or to shop for essential needs.</p>



<p>On May 4, 2020, an <a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/5.4.20-EO-N-60-20.pdf">Executive Order (PDF)</a> informed local health jurisdictions and industry sectors that they may gradually reopen under new modifications and guidance provided by the state per the May 7, 2020 <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/CDPH%20Document%20Library/COVID-19/SHO%20Order%205-7-2020.pdf">Public Health Order (PDF)</a>.</p>



<p>On August 28, 2020, the state released a <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/safer-economy/">Blueprint for a Safer Economy</a> in the state with revised criteria for loosening and tightening restrictions on activities.</p>



<p>See <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/essential-workforce/">essential jobs</a> and <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/safer-economy/">status of your county</a>.</p>



<h2 id="faq">Questions and answers</h2>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">What&#8217;s open in my county?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">You can check the open or closed status of more than 90 kinds of businesses or activities at the <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/safer-economy/">Blueprint for a Safer Economy</a>.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Where can I see a map of California&#8217;s counties with their tier levels?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">The Blueprint for a Safer Economy has a <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/safer-economy/#county-status">map of California</a> with each county&#8217;s current tier status: Widespread (purple), Substantial (red), Moderate (orange), or Minimal (yellow).</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">When does the stay home order go into effect and how long will we stay home? What areas of the state are covered?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">The order went into effect on Thursday, March 19, 2020. The order is in place until further notice. It covers the whole state of California.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">As of May 8, the stay home order was modified. In addition to essential activity,  retail is allowed, along with the infrastructure to support it. As of May 12, offices, limited services, and outdoor museums are also permitted to open.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">What is the relationship between the stay home order and these questions and answers?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">The Governor has ordered Californians to obey the directives of the State Public Health Officer. Those directives take many forms; they include specific materials linked on this page, as well as these questions and answers. These questions and answers are directives from the State Public Health Officer, and have the same force and effect as other State Public Health Officer directives.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Is it safe to shop at open businesses?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">The risk of COVID-19 infection is still real for all Californians and continues to be fatal. That is why every business permitted to open should take every step humanly possible to reduce the risk of infection by following these <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/industry-guidance/#top">state guidelines</a>.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Can the stay home order be changed?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Yes. The State Public Health Officer may issue new orders as the public health situation changes.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">How does the stay home order interact with local orders to shelter in place? Does it supersede them?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">This is a statewide order. Counties can have more restrictive criteria and different closures. See <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/safer-economy">your county&#8217;s status</a>.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">If I am not an Essential Critical Infrastructure Worker, can I still leave the house?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Yes. As described in more detail elsewhere in applicable state public health directives (including on this page), there are a wide range of circumstances in which you may leave your home or other place of residence, even if you are not an Essential Critical Infrastructure Worker. For example, you may leave your home to work at any business or other entity that is allowed to open, to engage in in-person worship and protest activities consistent with public health directives, to patronize local businesses, or to care for friends or family members who require assistance (as set forth under <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/healthcare/#top">Health care</a>). And errands like these are not the only reasons you may leave your home: you may also leave your home with or without a specific destination in mind (for example, to walk your dog, to engage in physical recreation, or simply to get some fresh air) as long as you maintain physical distancing and comply with any other applicable public health directives.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Are gatherings permitted?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Yes, some outdoor gatherings are permitted, but they must meet certain conditions. This is because gatherings pose an especially high danger of transmission and spread of COVID-19.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Gatherings are defined as events that bring together people from multiple households in one space, indoors or outdoors. That space could be as large as an arena or as small as a private home.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">On May 25, 2020, in an effort to balance First Amendment interests with public health, the State Public Health Officer created an exception to the prohibition against mass gatherings for faith-based services, cultural ceremonies, and protests. Those types of gatherings are now permitted indoors in counties in Substantial (red), Moderate (orange), and Minimal (yellow) tiers, subject to <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/industry-guidance/#worship">certain restrictions</a> in those counties.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">State public health directives also permit in-person outdoor faith-based services or protests as long as face coverings are worn and physical distancing of 6 feet between persons or groups of persons from different households is maintained at all times.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">As of October 9, 2020, outdoor private gatherings are allowed under the following conditions:</p>



<ul class="wp-accordion-content"><li>Attendees must be from no more than 3 separate households</li><li>Duration should be 2 hours or less</li></ul>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">At any gathering, observe these safety protocols:</p>



<ul class="wp-accordion-content"><li>Wear a&nbsp; mask, practice physical distancing, and wash your hands frequently</li><li>Do not attend if you have <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/symptoms-and-risks/">COVID-19 symptoms</a>&nbsp;</li><li>Do not attend if you are at <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/symptoms-and-risks/#higher-risk">high risk for serious illness</a> from COVID-19 (seniors, those with certain medical conditions)</li></ul>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Read more details in the state’s <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/CDPH-Guidance-for-the-Prevention-of-COVID-19-Transmission-for-Gatherings-10-09.aspx">private gatherings guidance</a>. Be aware that local health departments may have additional restrictions.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Crowds and limited physical distancing increase the risk for COVID-19. If you attended a gathering, remember that <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/get-tested/">confidential, free COVID-19 testing</a> is available. If you test negative it does not mean that you may not develop COVID-19 later on. Therefore, it is advisable that you self-isolate for 14 days if possible.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Can I get a haircut?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Yes. Hair salons and barbershops are now open throughout the state with modifications for safety. </p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Are weddings allowed?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Yes, but only wedding ceremonies are allowed, not receptions. Wedding ceremonies should follow the guidance for <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/industry-guidance/#worship">Places of worship or cultural ceremonies</a>. As required by that guidance, social distancing should be practiced by all attendees. Wear masks, wash hands frequently, and keep 6 feet from anyone you don’t live with.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Ceremonies have restrictions on their setting or capacity, depending on your county’s tier status:</p>



<ul class="wp-accordion-content"><li>Widespread (purple) tier:<br>Outdoors only</li><li>Substantial (red) tier:<br>May be held indoors, but with max capacity of 25% or 100 people, whichever is fewer</li><li>Moderate (orange) tier:<br>May be held indoors, but with max capacity of 50% or 200 people, whichever is fewer</li><li>Minimal (yellow) tier:<br>May be held indoors, but with max capacity of 50%</li></ul>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">While wedding receptions are not permitted,&nbsp;consider safer options like sharing your wedding online via video conference (Zoom, Google Meet, or other platforms). This protects all your loved ones, especially those at high risk like seniors or people with chronic conditions. See more details in guidance for <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/industry-guidance/#worship">Places of worship and cultural ceremonies</a>.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Are safety protocols being enforced? How do I report a business that isn&#8217;t complying?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">They are being enforced, and you can report it. Report unsafe conditions or businesses that shouldn’t be open to your local Alcohol Beverage Control, Labor Commissioner’s office, or regional Cal/OSHA office, depending on the type of business. To find these local contacts, see Appendix B of the <a href="https://files.covid19.ca.gov/pdf/employer-playbook-for-safe-reopening--en.pdf">Employer Playbook for a Safe Reopening (PDF)</a>.</p>



<div class="wp-accordion-content"><!-- Adding keywords mask masks report reporting enforce enforcement compliance for quick answers purposes --></div>



<h3 class="h2" id="political">Protected activities</h3>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">I want to express my political views.&nbsp; How can I make my voice heard without raising public health concerns?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">There are many ways for you to express your political views without holding a physical, in-person gathering.&nbsp; For example, you may continue to call or write elected officials, write letters to the editor of news publications, display lawn or window signs, or use online and other electronic media (including Zoom rooms, Twitter feeds, Facebook pages, and other digital forums) to express your views.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Additionally, as noted above, you may leave your home for any reason as long as you comply with any other applicable public health directives. When you are otherwise out in public, public health directives do not prevent you from engaging in political expression—such as by wearing or carrying a sign.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">If collective action in physical space is important to you, consider whether you and other participants can safely protest from within your cars.&nbsp; The State Public Health Officer does not consider in-car activities to be gatherings, if participants stay in their cars and otherwise remain apart from individuals who are not part of their households.&nbsp; Many activists have organized car-based protests (honking horns, flying flags, displaying signs, and so on) to express their political views while complying with State public health directives.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Whenever you are considering a protest (including an in-car protest), make sure you comply with all other applicable laws, including any local public-health measures that may be more restrictive than statewide directives and any other applicable local laws.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">If you do wish to engage in in-person protest outside of your car with a group of any size, you must follow the guidelines for political protest gatherings below.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Can I engage in political protest gatherings?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Yes, although in-person protests present special public health concerns.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Even with adherence to physical distancing, bringing members of different households together to engage in in-person protest carries a higher risk of widespread transmission of COVID-19. &nbsp;Such gatherings may result in increased rates of infection, hospitalization, and death, especially among more vulnerable populations. In particular, activities like chanting, shouting, singing, and group recitation negate the risk-reduction achieved through 6 feet of physical distancing. For this reason, people engaging in these activities should wear face coverings at all times. </p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Therefore, it is strongly recommended that those exercising their right to engage in political expression (including, for example, their right to petition the government) should utilize alternative channels, such as the many online and broadcasting platforms available in the digital age, in place of in-person gatherings.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">However, state public health directives do not prohibit in-person <em>outdoor</em> protests as long as you maintain a physical distance of 6 feet between persons or groups of persons from different households at all times. When you can&#8217;t maintain a safe physical distance of 6 feet from people not in your household, you must wear a face covering or mask. Local Health Officers are advised to consider appropriate limitations on outdoor attendance capacities, factoring their jurisdiction&#8217;s key COVID-19 health indicators. Failure to follow these requirements may result in an order to disperse or other enforcement action.&nbsp;Masks and face coverings are strongly recommended.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">In counties in the <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/safer-economy/">Widespread (purple) tier</a>, indoor protests are not currently permitted. In other counties, state public health directives do not prohibit in-person&nbsp;<em>indoor</em> protests as long as&nbsp;(1) attendance is limited as required by the <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/safer-economy">relevant restrictions</a> on places of worship, (2)&nbsp;physical distancing of 6 feet between persons or groups of persons from different households is maintained at all times, and (3) singing and chanting activities are discontinued.&nbsp;Failure to follow these requirements may result in an order to disperse or other enforcement action.&nbsp;Masks and face coverings are required in compliance with CDPH directives.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Participants must maintain a physical distance of 6 feet from any uniformed peace officers and other public safety personnel present, unless otherwise directed, and follow all other requirements and directives imposed by local health officers and law enforcement, or other applicable authorities.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">This limitation on attendance will be reviewed regularly. This review will assess the impacts of these imposed limits on public health and provide further direction as part of a phased-in restoration of gatherings that implicate the First Amendment.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion" id="vote">How do I vote?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content"><strong><a href="http://files.covid19.ca.gov/pdf/CDPH-to-SOS-Letter-from-Acting-HO-Aug-18-1.pdf">Elections are an essential activity</a>.</strong> The Governor has issued&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/2020/05/08/governor-newsom-issues-executive-order-to-protect-public-health-by-mailing-every-registered-voter-a-ballot-ahead-of-the-november-general-election/">executive orders to ensure elections are safe and accessible</a>. Vote-by-mail ballots will be sent to all registered voters for the November 3, 2020 General Election. Most counties will provide&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/2020/06/03/governor-newsom-signs-executive-order-on-safe-secure-and-accessible-general-election-in-november/">three days of early voting</a>&nbsp;in-person starting the Saturday before the election. Open ballot drop-box locations will be available between October 6 and November 3, 2020. Existing laws addressing the use of vote-by-mail ballots in California elections remain in effect except where suspended by Executive Order.

<p class="wp-accordion-content">Practice physical distancing and follow other applicable public health directives while engaged in election-related activities. These include collection and drop-off of ballots, and collection of signatures to qualify candidates or measures for the ballot.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Can I go to church?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Yes. Places of worship such as churches, mosques, temples, and synagogues can open throughout the state, with <a href="https://files.covid19.ca.gov/pdf/guidance-places-of-worship--en.pdf">modifications for safety (PDF)</a>. In counties in the <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/safer-economy">Widespread (purple)</a> tier, indoor services in places of worship must be discontinued but outdoor and online services are permitted.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Can I practice my religious faith?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Yes. Practicing your faith is a constitutionally-protected activity and may manifest in many different forms.<!-- church, mosque, synagogue, temple, wedding, funeral, baptism --></p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Although in-person religious gatherings—like other in-person gatherings—have been restricted to prevent the transmission of COVID-19, on May 25, 2020, the State Public Health Officer began to ease restrictions on in-person religious gatherings. In particular, the State Public Health Officer now authorizes County Departments of Public Health to allow collective activities at places of worship, subject to conditions to support a safe, clean environment for employees, interns and trainees, volunteers, scholars, and all other types of workers as well as congregants, worshippers, and visitors.<!-- church, mosque, synagogue, temple, wedding, funeral, baptism --></p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">What conditions must be met to resume religious services and cultural ceremonies at places of worship?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Information on conditions imposed by the state can be found at <a href="https://files.covid19.ca.gov/pdf/guidance-places-of-worship--en.pdf">guidance for places of worship (PDF)</a>. Additional conditions may be imposed by local public health officials. This guidance does not obligate places of worship to resume in-person activity. It is strongly recommended that places of worship continue to facilitate remote services and other alternatives to in-person religious practice for those who are vulnerable to COVID19.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Even with adherence to physical distancing, convening in a congregational setting of multiple households to practice a personal faith carries a higher risk of widespread transmission of COVID-19, and may result in increased rates of infection, hospitalization, and death, especially among more vulnerable populations. In particular, activities like singing and group recitation dramatically increase the risk of COVID-19 transmission. For this reason, singing and chanting activities must be discontinued at indoor services, and congregants engaging in group recitation should wear face coverings at all times.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Places of worship may only open indoor operations when permitted by <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/safer-economy">relevant local restrictions</a> and must comply with all applicable attendance limitations and guidance requirements.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Local Health Officers are advised to consider appropriate limitations on&nbsp;<em>outdoor&nbsp;</em>attendance capacities, factoring their jurisdiction&#8217;s key COVID-19 health indicators. At a minimum, outdoor attendance should be limited naturally through implementation of strict physical distancing measures of a minimum of 6 feet between attendees from different households, in addition to other relevant protocols within this document. </p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">This limitation will be regularly reviewed by the California Department of Public Health.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Can children attend group activities (like Sunday school or Hebrew school) at places of worship?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Yes.&nbsp; Outdoor activities are permitted, and indoor activities are permitted if they comply with the <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/small-groups-child-youth.aspx">cohort guidance</a>.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">When will current conditions change for places of worship?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">The California Department of Public Health, in consultation with county Departments of Public Health, will regularly review and assess the impacts of these imposed limits on public health and provide further direction as part of a phased-in restoration of activities in places of worship. </p>



<h3 class="h2" id="outdoor">Outdoor recreation</h3>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Can I still exercise? Take my kids to the park for fresh air? Take a walk around the block?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">It’s okay to go outside to go for a walk, to exercise, and participate in healthy activities as long as you <strong>maintain a safe physical distance of 6 feet and gather only with members of your household.</strong> You can also participate in activities at <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/industry-guidance/#campgrounds-outdoor-recreation">outdoor playgrounds and recreational facilities</a> that are allowed to open. <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/public-recreation/">Parks may be closed</a> to help slow the spread of the virus. Young people can participate in sports as permitted by the <a href="https://files.covid19.ca.gov/pdf/guidance-youth-sports--en.pdf">youth sports guidance (PDF)</a>.

<p class="wp-accordion-content">You can walk your dog. You can go to the vet or pet hospital if your pet is sick. Remember to wear a face covering and distance yourself at least 6 feet from other pets and owners.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Can I visit State Parks? What outdoor spaces are open?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">State Parks, campgrounds, museums, and visitor centers <a href="https://www.parks.ca.gov/?page_id=30350">may continue to be closed</a> to help slow the spread of the virus. Starting June 12, some counties may open campgrounds and RV parks. Be sure to check <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/public-recreation/">parks in your area before you travel</a>. Californians should not travel significant distances for pleasure or recreation and should stay close to home. If you do travel, take steps to keep everyone safe like wearing a face covering, keeping 6 feet of physical distance from those not in your household, and washing your hands frequently.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">You can walk, run, hike and bike in your local neighborhoods as long as they continue to practice physical distancing of 6 feet. This means avoiding crowded trails and parking lots. </p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content"><a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/industry-guidance/#campgrounds-outdoor-recreation">Outdoor playgrounds</a> may also open if they are operated by city, state, county, or federal government.

<h4 class="wp-accordion">Can I travel?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">You can travel for urgent matters or if such travel is essential to your permitted work. Even though businesses around the state are opening up, avoid travelling long distances for vacations or pleasure as much as possible. This is to slow the spread of the coronavirus. Do not travel if you are sick, or if someone in your household has had coronavirus in the last two weeks. Do not travel with someone who is sick. </p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">You should check with the local health department where you are starting from, along your route, and at your planned destination for information.

<h4 class="wp-accordion">Can I get my car smog checked?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">It depends. Some smog check locations may be closed. The <a href="https://www.bar.ca.gov/COVID-19_Impacts_on_BAR_Programs_and_Services.aspx">Bureau of Automotive Repair</a> advises drivers to still pay DMV vehicle registration fees to avoid any late fees. However, you will not receive your new registration or year sticker until the smog information has been received by DMV. Once state and local orders or directives are no longer in effect, you can then obtain the required smog check certificate to complete the DMV vehicle registration process.</p>
