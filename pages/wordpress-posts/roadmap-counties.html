<h2><strong>County data monitoring</strong></h2>



<p>California is&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/COVID19CountyMonitoringOverview.aspx">monitoring COVID-19 closely</a>&nbsp;in each local community and keeping the public informed. We’re teaming up with counties to fight it with every tool we have:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/COVID19CountyDataTable.aspx">current local data</a>, testing, contact tracing, infection control, emergency supplies, containment measures, and more.</p>



<p>Counties should be ready to restore limitations if outbreaks increase. The State Public Health Officer may take action if needed.</p>



<p>Effective July 13, 2020, ALL counties must close indoor operations in these sectors:</p>



<ul><li>Dine-in restaurants</li><li>Wineries and tasting rooms</li><li>Movie theaters&nbsp;</li><li>Family entertainment centers (for example: bowling alleys, miniature golf, batting cages and arcades)</li><li>Zoos and museums</li><li>Cardrooms</li></ul>



<p>Additionally, bars, brewpubs, breweries, and pubs must close all operations both indoor and outdoor statewide,&nbsp;unless they are offering sit-down, <strong>outdoor</strong> dining. Alcohol can only be sold in the same transaction as a meal.</p>



<p>Counties that have remained on the County Monitoring List for 3 consecutive days will be required to shut down the following industries or activities unless they can be modified to operate outside or by pick-up.</p>



<ul><li>Gyms and fitness centers</li><li>Places of worship and cultural ceremonies, like weddings and funerals </li><li>Offices for non-critical infrastructure sectors </li><li>Personal care services, like nail salons and body waxing </li><li>Hair salons and barbershops</li><li>Shopping malls</li></ul>



<p>Shops that offer tattoos, piercings and electrolysis may not be operated outdoors and must close.</p>

<h4>County monitoring list updates (8/17/2020)</h4>



<p>California Department of Public Health has updated the County Monitoring List (CML) now that the recent backlog of data has been cleared.&nbsp; As a result, CDPH has retroactively updated the list for each day over the entire period impacted (July 25 – August 16).</p>



<p>If a county should have moved off the CML while the list was frozen, that date is being calculated retroactively. The calculation will use the first date after three consecutive days of being under the threshold for the CML metrics.</p>



<p>If a county moved onto the CML during the period the list was frozen&nbsp;(August 1&nbsp;through&nbsp;August 16),&nbsp;they&nbsp;are allowed&nbsp;a 48 hour time period&nbsp;to implement&nbsp;sector&nbsp;closures&nbsp;in compliance with the July 13 order.&nbsp;New closures&nbsp;must&nbsp;be effective by 11:59pm, August 19th.</p>



<p>Counties on the list below are currently on the County Monitoring List. Retroactive dates were added for counties newly added during the list freeze:</p>

<p>Once a county appears on the County Monitoring List for three consecutive days, indoor operations in the sectors listed in Section 3 of the <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/CDPH%20Document%20Library/COVID-19/SHO%20Order%20Dimming%20Entire%20State%207-13-2020.pdf">July 13<sup>th</sup> State Health Officer Order</a> must close.</p>



<ul><li>The July 13<sup>th</sup> order specifies that these indoor operations shall remain closed, even when a county is removed from the County Monitoring List, until the State Health Officer modifies the Order and authorizes re-opening.</li><li>The State of California is actively reassessing the July 13<sup>th</sup> order in light of evolving scientific evidence regarding disease transmission and the risk of transmission in different settings and will provide updates in the coming week</li></ul>

<h3>County attestation process</h3>



<p>Local health jurisdictions that meet the criteria set forth by the California Department of Public Health and follow the process in the <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/County_Variance_Attestation_Form.aspx">county guidance</a> may move further ahead in the Resilience Roadmap.</p>



<p>If a county decides to pursue a variance to move further ahead in the Resilience Roadmap, the local public health officer must:</p>



<ol><li>Notify the California Department of Public Health (CDPH).</li><li>Certify through submission of a written attestation to CDPH that the county has met the readiness criteria (outlined below), including guidance to be issued by the county and detailed plans, and that the county is designed to mitigate the spread of COVID-19.</li></ol>



<p>See the <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/County_Variance_Attestation_Form.aspx">list of counties</a> that have met the criteria.</p>
