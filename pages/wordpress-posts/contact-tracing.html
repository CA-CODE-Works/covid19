<h2 id="what-is-contact-tracing">What is contact tracing?</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Contact tracing is when health workers trace, notify, and monitor the contacts of infected people.</strong> They let you know that you&#8217;ve been in <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/php/contact-tracing/contact-tracing-plan/appendix.html#contact">close contact</a> with an infected person, and advise you what to do next. Public health departments have used contact tracing for decades to fight infectious disease.</td><td><img src="http://files.covid19.ca.gov/img/Asset1-1.png" alt="" style="width: 1000px;"></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h3>How does it work?</h3>



<p>Under this program, health workers talk to those who have tested positive. They alert anyone they may have exposed, keeping names confidential.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table is-style-regular"><table><tbody><tr><td><img src="http://files.covid19.ca.gov/img/Asset5at2x1.png" alt="" style="width: 500px;"></td><td>Contact tracers will:<br>&#8211; Notify of exposure<br>&#8211; Check symptoms<br>&#8211; Offer testing<br>&#8211; Discuss next steps like testing, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/quarantine.html">quarantine</a>, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/isolation.html">self-isolation</a>, and medical care</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>Introducing <strong>California Connected</strong>, our state’s contact tracing program.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image text-center"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized">
    <img width="302" src="https://files.covid19.ca.gov/img/CAConnected_Logo_Tag_4C--en.png" alt="Connected California">
  </figure></div>



<p>By finding spread patterns quickly, we slow infection and help avoid <a href="https://files.covid19.ca.gov/pdf/employer-playbook-for-safe-reopening--en.pdf">outbreaks</a>. This lets California keep healthcare needs below capacity and safely reopen businesses.</p>



<h3>How you can participate</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>All you have to do is answer a phone call.</strong><br>Contact tracing is an anonymous way to do your part. The more people answer the call, the more lives and jobs California saves. Your information is always kept confidential.</td><td><img src="http://files.covid19.ca.gov/img/Asset4at2x1.png" alt="" style="width: 500px;"></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>Early awareness helps you protect your friends and loved ones from exposure. And early medical care can improve your outcome.</p>



<p>The sooner we can reach you, the sooner you can get advice, testing, and support.</p>



<h2 id="what-a-contact-tracer-will-ask">What a contact tracer will ask and offer</h2>

<h3>Know that you are not alone</h3>



<p>Pandemics can be stressful. Fear and anxiety about a new disease and what could happen can be overwhelming and cause strong emotions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Coping with stress in a healthy way will make you, the people you care about, and your community stronger. See this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTx1vELv7zU">CDC video</a> about managing anxiety and stress.</p>



<p>If you feel like you need to talk to someone and want emotional support, see this<a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/resources-for-emotional-support-and-well-being/#top"> list of resources</a>. The California Surgeon General released<a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/manage-stress-for-health/#top"> two playbooks for managing stress</a> and tips for caregivers and kids.</p>



<h2 id="other-programs">Other notification programs</h2>



<h3>California COVID Notify exposure notification</h3>



<p>California COVID Notify is a pilot project at UCSD and UCSF to test Google and Apple’s Exposure Notification Express mobile system. It detects if participants were near someone with COVID-19 through anonymous keys exchanged with their phones via Bluetooth.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This pilot will only be open to students and employees at these universities.</p>



<p>California will review the results and decide whether to make the technology available statewide.</p>



<h2 id="questions">Questions and answers</h2>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">What is a close contact?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">A <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/php/contact-tracing/contact-tracing-plan/appendix.html#contact">close contact</a> is someone who was within 6 feet of a person with COVID-19 for at least 15 minutes over a 24-hour period starting from 2 days before symptoms appeared (or, for asymptomatic patients, 2 days prior to their test) until the time the patient is isolated.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">You are also a close contact if:</p>



<ul class="wp-accordion-content"><li>You provided care at home to someone who is sick with COVID-19</li><li>You had direct physical contact with the person (hugging or kissing them)</li><li>You shared eating or drinking utensils</li><li>They sneezed, coughed, or somehow got respiratory droplets on you.</li></ul>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Am I considered a close contact if I was wearing a mask?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Yes, you are still considered a <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/php/contact-tracing/contact-tracing-plan/appendix.html#contact">close contact</a> even if you were wearing a mask while you were around someone with COVID-19. Masks may offer some protection to the wearer, but are mainly meant to protect other people in case you are infected.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Will contact tracers track my location?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">California’s contact tracing program does not use any cell phone tracking technology.
