<h2>California COVID Notify app</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://files.covid19.ca.gov/img/CACovidNotify.png" alt="California COVID Notify app logo"/></figure>



<p><strong>Effective as of September 21, 2020</strong></p>



<p>This Privacy Policy describes how the California Department of Public Health protects the privacy of users installing the new exposure notification mobile application (app) – California COVID Notify. The policy explains how the data collected through the California COVID Notify app is stored and processed, and the choices available to the users in terms of app usage. </p>



<h3>About the California COVID Notify app</h3>



<p>The California COVID Notify exposure notification app allows users to send and receive notifications of a potential high-risk exposure to COVID-19, in a privacy-preserving manner. The notifications will include instructions on who to contact and how to get tested. </p>



<p>The exposure notifications are intended to supplement the conventional contact tracing efforts undertaken by the state and local public health authorities involving contact by a case worker. </p>



<h3>How it works&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>



<p>The California COVID Notify app does not require the collection or exchange of any personal information, as defined in the California Information Practices Act, of the user to receive notifications.</p>



<p>The mobile devices of the app users share anonymous keys (randomly generated strings of numbers) via Bluetooth. The only data collected by the app are the anonymous keys, Bluetooth signal strength (proximity), date and duration of exposure. This information is not linked to a user’s identity or location. Each user&#8217;s keys change frequently to further protect their identity. The data is stored on the user’s mobile device for a period of 14 days and then automatically deleted. Once deleted the data cannot be restored.</p>



<p>A user who tests positive for COVID-19, may choose to notify other California COVID Notify app users who may have had close contact with the user. To trigger such notification, the COVID-19 positive user must enter a valid verification code provided by the medical provider, lab, or local public health authority. </p>



<p>Several times a day, the app downloads a list of all the anonymous keys associated with positive COVID-19 cases that have elected to share their keys via the app.  The app checks these keys against the list of keys it has encountered in the past 14 days. If there is a match, and the date, duration, and proximity aligns with the public health authority’s risk model to indicate a possible exposure to the virus, the user will receive an exposure notification.</p>



<p>The notification will inform the user of the date of exposure and instructions on what to do next.</p>



<h3>User consent &amp; choices</h3>



<h4>Using the app</h4>



<p>The app has the potential to help stop the spread of infections and its use is highly encouraged. However, use of the California COVID Notify app is completely voluntary.</p>



<p>Users may install and uninstall the app at any time. The app does not collect, track or store users’ location, GPS information, or personal information.</p>



<h4>Disabling exposure notifications</h4>



<p>Users may disable California COVID Notify at any time by uninstalling the app or turning off the mobile device Bluetooth signals.  </p>



<h4>Generating exposure notifications to other users</h4>



<p>Providing notification to other users is also completely voluntary. If an app user tests positive for COVID-19, and chooses to notify others, the user has to activate notifications by entering a verification code to release the anonymous keys stored on the mobile device. When anonymous keys are released, the notifications that may be generated do not disclose the COVID-19 positive user’s identity, location, phone number or any other personal information.</p>



<p>The exposure notice includes the date of the exposure, but the COVID-19 positive user’s identity is not shared. Sharing the exposure date is important to ensure the right precautions (such as self-quarantine) are taken for an appropriate amount of time based on the exposure date. It is possible that someone who receives an exposure notice could guess the identity of the COVID-19 positive individual, if they had a limited number of contacts on a given day.</p>



<p>A verification code is required to share a positive test result in the app. This ensure that only verified positive test result are used to generate exposure notifications. Verification codes may only be generated by a medical provider, lab, or public health authority.</p>



<h4>Sharing of information</h4>



<p>The following categories of de-identified data may be processed and collected in the California COVID Notify app:</p>



<ul><li>Installing the app</li><li>Enabling and disabling exposure notifications</li><li>Receiving an exposure notification</li><li>Entering a verification code to send anonymous keys</li><li>Anonymous keys that have been voluntarily shared</li><li>Deleting the app</li></ul>



<p>The data may be used to monitor app usage, and performance evaluation, and for statistical or scientific research purposes. The data may also be shared with local public health authorities and the University of California. This information will not include any personal or location information nor can it be used to identify any app user.</p>



<h4>Age requirements</h4>



<p>California COVID Notify is not intended for children under the age of 13. Users between the ages of 13 and 17, can only use the app after the parent or legal guardian has reviewed and consented to the app. </p>



<h3>Changes to our Privacy Policy</h3>



<p>CDPH may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Users will be notified of any material changes to this Privacy Policy through the app. The notification will indicate when such changes will become effective.</p>



<p>Users who object to a new Privacy Policy, may terminate participation in the California COVID Notify app by deleting or uninstalling the app.</p>
