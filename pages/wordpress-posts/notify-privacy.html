<h2>California COVID Notify app</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://files.covid19.ca.gov/img/CACovidNotify.png" alt=""/></figure>



<p><strong>Effective as of September 21, 2020</strong></p>



<p>This Privacy Policy describes how the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) protects the privacy of users installing the new exposure notification mobile application (app) – California COVID Notify. The policy explains how the data collected through the California COVID Notify app is stored and processed, and the choices available to the users in terms of app usage.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>About the California COVID Notify app</h3>



<p>The California COVID Notify exposure notification app allows users to send and receive notifications of a potential high-risk exposure to COVID-19, in a privacy-preserving manner. The notifications will include instructions on who to contact, and how to get tested.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The exposure notifications are intended to supplement the conventional contact tracing efforts undertaken by the state and local public health authorities involving contact by a caseworker.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>How it works&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>



<p>The California COVID Notify app does not require the collection or exchange of any personal information, as defined in the California Information Practices Act, of the user to receive notifications.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The mobile devices of the app users share anonymous keys (randomly generated strings of numbers) via Bluetooth. The only data collected by the app are the anonymous keys, Bluetooth signal strength, and date and duration of exposure. This information is not linked to a user’s identity or location. Each user&#8217;s keys change frequently to further protect their identity. The data is stored on the user’s mobile device for a period of 14 days and then automatically deleted. Once deleted the data cannot be restored.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A user who tests positive for COVID-19, may choose to notify other California COVID Notify app users who may have had close contact with the user. To trigger such a notification, the COVID-19 positive must enter a valid PIN provided by the medical provider, lab, or local public health authority.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Several times a day, the app downloads a list of all the anonymous keys associated with positive COVID-19 cases and checks them against the list of keys it has encountered in the past 14 days. If there is a match, based on the date, duration, and Bluetooth signal attenuation (proximity indicator), it will indicate a possible exposure to the virus.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The notification will inform the user of the date of exposure and instructions on who to contact and how to get tested.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>User consent &amp; choices</h3>



<h4>Using the app</h4>



<p>The app has the potential to limit infections and its use is highly encouraged. However, use of the California COVID Notify app is completely voluntary.</p>



<p>Users may install and uninstall the app at any time. The app does not collect, track or store users’ location, GPS information, or personal information.</p>



<h4>Disabling exposure notifications</h4>



<p>Users may disable California COVID Notify at any time by uninstalling the app or turning off the mobile device Bluetooth signals.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h4>Generating exposure notifications to other users</h4>



<p>A COVID-19 positive user may choose to notify other app users who may have come into contact with the user. Providing notification to other users is completely voluntary. The notification will not disclose the COVID-19 positive user’s identity, location or any personal information. A user may obtain a PIN from their test provider or through their local health jurisdiction’s contact tracing team.</p>



<h4>Sharing of information</h4>



<p>The following event data may be processed and collected in the California COVID Notify app:</p>



<ul><li>Installing the app</li><li>Enabling and disabling exposure notifications</li><li>Receiving an exposure notification</li><li>Submitting a verified PIN</li><li>Uploading data from COVID-19 positive users that have chosen to notify others</li><li>Deleting the app</li></ul>



<p>The event information may be used to understand how the app is being used. This data may be shared with local public health authorities. It may be used in aggregate and anonymous form for statistical or scientific research purposes. This information will not include any personal or location information nor can it be used to identify any app user.</p>



<h4>Age requirements</h4>



<p>California COVID Notify is not intended for children under the age of 13. Users between the ages of 13 and 17 can only use the app after the parent or legal guardian has reviewed and consented to the app.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Changes to our Privacy Policy</h3>
