<p>All Californians—regardless of where they live, their working environment, their social supports, or how they identify⁠—deserve a healthy life.</p>



<p>COVID-19 has highlighted existing inequities in health. Committed to a California for All, the state is identifying communities most impacted and directing resources to address COVID-19 health inequities. Reducing COVID-19 risk in all communities is good for everyone, and California is committed to making it part of our reopening plan.</p>



<p>State public health leaders cannot address COVID-19 health inequities alone. A healthy California for everyone requires partnership with the private sector, local government, and community partners at all levels.</p>

            <p>To ensure we build a California for All, counties must address COVID-19 health inequities in their economic reopening plans. Each week, state officials work with local health departments to measure case rates and positivity rates, as well as positivity rates in the county’s most disproportionately-impacted neighborhoods (health equity metric).</p>

              <li>Define their disproportionately impacted populations and measure COVID-19 metrics and response (contract tracing, isolation support, worker protections) in these populations</li>
              <li>Show how they will use state funds to support disproportionately-impacted communities</li>
              <li>Show that the health equity metric does not significantly lag behind its overall county positivity rate</li>

<cagov-county-search></cagov-county-search>



<h3>COVID-19 impact by race and ethnicity</h3>



<p>Latino, Black, and Pacific Islander communities have been disproportionately affected by COVID-19. We have made some strides in addressing disparities within these communities, but we must do better.</p>



<h3>COVID-19 health equity metric</h3>



<p>The health equity metric measures the positivity rate in the most disproportionately-impacted communities. These communities are identified in the Healthy Places Index as census tracts that have less healthy community conditions such as low median income, education completeness, and health care access. The Blueprint for a Safer Economy ensures that counties address COVID-19 in all communities. To open further, the health equity metric cannot significantly lag behind overall county positivity rates.</p>
