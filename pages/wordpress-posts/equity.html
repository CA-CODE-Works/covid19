<p>All Californians—regardless of where they live, their working environment, their social supports, or how they identify⁠—deserve a healthy life.</p>



<p>COVID-19 has highlighted existing inequities in health. Committed to a California for All, the state is identifying communities most impacted and directing resources to address COVID-19 health inequities. Reducing COVID-19 risk in all communities is good for everyone, and California is committed to making it part of our reopening plan.</p>



<p>State public health leaders cannot address COVID-19 health inequities alone. A healthy California for everyone requires partnership with the private sector, local government, and community partners at all levels.</p>

<h3>COVID-19 impact by race and ethnicity</h3>



<p>Latino, Black, and Pacific Islander communities have been disproportionately affected by COVID-19. We have made some strides in addressing disparities within these communities, but we must do better.</p>



<h3>COVID-19 health equity metric</h3>



<p>The health equity metric measures the positivity rate in the most disproportionately-impacted communities. These communities are identified in the Healthy Places Index as census tracts that have less healthy community conditions such as low median income, education completeness, and health care access. The Blueprint for a Safer Economy ensures that counties address COVID-19 in all communities. To open further, the health equity metric cannot significantly lag behind overall county positivity rates.</p>

<h3>Data completeness is critical to addressing inequity</h3>



<p>We know a lot about the impact of COVID-19 on certain communities, but we can better invest our resources by increasing the collection of race, ethnicity, and sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI) data. This data collection requires close cooperation with private sector partners, laboratories, and state and county officials. Learn more about SOGI data collection.</p>
