<p>All Californians—regardless of where they live, their working environment, their social supports, or how they identify⁠—deserve a healthy life.</p>



<p>COVID-19 has highlighted existing inequities in health. Committed to a California for All, the state is identifying communities most impacted and directing resources to address COVID-19 health inequities. Reducing COVID-19 risk in all communities is good for everyone, and California is committed to making it part of our reopening plan.</p>



<p>State public health leaders cannot address COVID-19 health inequities alone. A healthy California for everyone requires partnership with the private sector, local government, and community partners at all levels.</p>

            <h3 class="color-white">What we’ve done</h3>
            <p>California has taken action to begin addressing health equity. In the Central Valley, we’ve implemented several programs to help those most affected. These efforts included:</p>
            <ul class="bullet-orange">
              <li>Creating Housing for the Harvest to help farm workers self-isolate</li>
              <li>Increasing mobile testing capacity</li>
              <li>Translating resources into new languages to reach American Indians</li>
              <li>Raising awareness of resources available to farm workers</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 class="color-white">What we need to do</h3>
            <p>To ensure we build a California for All, counties must address COVID-19 health inequities in their economic reopening plans. Each week, state officials work with local health departments to measure overall county case rates and positivity rates, as well as positivity rates in the county’s most disproportionately-impacted neighborhoods (<a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/equity/#learn-more">health equity metric</a>).</p>
            <p>As part of this broad effort, counties must:</p>
            <ul class="bullet-orange">
              <li>Define their disproportionately impacted populations and measure COVID-19 metrics and response (contract tracing, isolation support, worker protections) in these populations</li>
              <li>Show how they will use state funds to support disproportionately-impacted communities</li>
              <li>Show that the health equity metric does not significantly lag behind its overall county positivity rate</li>
            </ul>

<h3 class="text-center mt-5">COVID-19 health equity metric</h3>



<p>The health equity metric measures the positivity rate in the most disproportionately-impacted communities. These communities are identified in the <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/equity/#learn-more">Healthy Places Index</a> as census tracts that have less healthy community conditions such as low median income, education completeness, and health care access. The <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/equity/#learn-more">Blueprint for a Safer Economy</a> ensures that counties address COVID-19 in all communities. To open further, the health equity metric cannot significantly lag behind overall county positivity rates.</p>
