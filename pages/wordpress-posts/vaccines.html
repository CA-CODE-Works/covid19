<h2 id="A-COVID-19-vaccine-is-here">A COVID-19 vaccine is here</h2>



<p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued an <a href="https://www.fda.gov/emergency-preparedness-and-response/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19/pfizer-biontech-covid-19-vaccine">Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for the first COVID-19 vaccine</a>. More vaccines may be authorized before the end of the year.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Vaccine safety is a top priority</h3>



<p>COVID-19 vaccines authorized by FDA have been carefully evaluated in clinical trials.</p>



<p>The U.S. vaccine safety system ensures that all vaccines are as safe as possible. Learn how the federal government is working to <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety.html">ensure the safety of COVID-19 vaccines</a>.</p>



<p>To ensure the COVID-19 vaccine meets safety requirements, California formed a <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/Scientific-Safety-Review-Workgroup.aspx">Scientific Safety Review Workgroup</a> to provide recommendations to California leadership and build public confidence in vaccine safety.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/Scientific-Safety-Review-Workgroup.aspx">Scientific Safety Review Workgroup</a> completed their concurrent and thorough review of the federal process and has <a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/2020/12/13/western-states-scientific-safety-review-workgroup-confirms-the-pfizer-vaccine-is-safe-and-efficacious-for-public-use/">confirmed that the COVID-19 vaccine is safe and efficacious</a>.</p>



<h2 class="Who gets vaccinated first" id="When-can-I-get-vaccinated">When can I get vaccinated?</h2>



<p>California will distribute and administer vaccines as soon as they are available. California will be transparent, careful, and equitable in its vaccine distribution.</p>



<p>Initially vaccine supply will be very limited. At first, vaccines will be provided to healthcare workers and long-term care residents in accordance with the <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/CDPH-Allocation-Guidelines-for-COVID-19-Vaccine-During-Phase-1A-Recommendations.aspx">CDPH Allocation Guidelines for COVID-19 Vaccine During Phase 1A</a>.</p>



<p>This will be followed by essential workers and others at highest risk of becoming infected or severely ill with COVID-19.</p>



<h2 id="How-COVID-19-vaccines-work">How COVID-19 vaccines work</h2>



<p>Vaccines help our immune system fight infections in the future. COVID-19 vaccines will protect us from the virus that causes COVID-19 without having to get the illness.</p>



<p>It typically takes a few weeks after the last dose in a series to become fully protected. Sometimes vaccination can cause mild fever or cold-like symptoms, but these are not harmful.</p>



<h2 id="Benefits-of-getting-vaccinated">Benefits of getting vaccinated</h2>



<p>COVID-19 vaccines are meant to prevent you from getting COVID-19 and from spreading it to others. The ability of COVID-19 vaccines to protect us from spreading the virus to others is not yet known, but is being studied carefully.</p>



<h2 id="Busting-myths-about-vaccination">Busting myths about vaccination</h2>



<h3>COVID-19 vaccines will not give you COVID-19</h3>



<p>COVID-19 vaccination can’t cause COVID-19. The goal of the vaccines&nbsp; is to teach our immune systems how to fight the virus that causes COVID-19. Learn more about <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/about-vaccines/how-they-work.html">how COVID-19 vaccines work</a>.</p>



<h3>COVID-19 vaccines will not cause you to test positive on COVID-19 viral tests</h3>



<p>Vaccines won’t cause you to test positive on <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/testing/diagnostic-testing.html">viral tests</a>, which are used to see if you have a current infection.</p>



<p>If your body develops an immune response, which is the goal of vaccination, there is a possibility you may test positive on some <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/testing/serology-overview.html">antibody tests</a>. Antibody tests indicate you had a previous infection and that you may have some level of protection against the virus. Experts are currently looking at how COVID-19 vaccination may affect antibody testing results.</p>



<h3>People who have gotten sick with COVID-19 may still benefit from getting vaccinated</h3>



<p>People are advised to get a COVID-19 vaccine even if they have been sick with COVID-19 before. This is due to the severe health risks associated with COVID-19 and the fact that re-infection with COVID-19 is possible.</p>



<p>At this time, we do not know how long someone is protected from getting sick again after recovering from COVID-19.</p>



<p>We won’t know how long immunity produced by vaccination lasts until we have a vaccine and more data on how well it works.</p>



<h3>Vaccination can help prevent getting sick with COVID-19</h3>



<p>While many people with COVID-19 have only a mild illness, others may get a <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html">severe illness</a> or even die. There is no way to know how COVID-19 will affect you, even if you are not at <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/index.html">increased risk of severe complications</a>. COVID-19 vaccination helps protect you without having to get the disease.

<h2 id="Questions-and-answers">Questions and answers</h2>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Will I still need to wear a mask after getting a COVID-19 vaccine?&nbsp;</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Yes. How much protection the COVID-19 vaccines provide under real-life conditions is still unknown. It is important for everyone to continue using all the tools available to us to help stop this pandemic, like:</p>



<ul class="wp-accordion-content"><li><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/steps-when-sick.html"><strong>Staying home and isolating</strong></a><strong> from others when sick</strong></li><li>Wearing masks&nbsp;</li><li>Washing hands often</li><li>Social distancing</li></ul>



<p class="wp-accordion-content"> Together, COVID-19 vaccination and recommendations for <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/prevention.html">how to protect yourself and others</a> will offer the best protection from getting and spreading COVID-19. We need to understand more about the protection that COVID-19 vaccines provide before we change recommendations on mask use.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">How many COVID-19 vaccine doses are needed?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Two shots.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">How much will the COVID-19 vaccine cost?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Vaccines purchased with U.S. taxpayer dollars will be given to the American people at no cost. </p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">What steps are being taken to ensure that COVID-19 vaccines are safe?&nbsp;</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">The CDC and FDA encourage the public to report possible side effects (called adverse events) to the <a href="https://vaers.hhs.gov/reportevent.html">Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS)</a>. This national system collects these data to look for:</p>



<ul class="wp-accordion-content"><li>Adverse events that are unexpected</li><li>Appear to happen more often than expected</li><li>Have unusual patterns of occurrence</li></ul>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Learn about the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/ensuringsafety/sideeffects/index.html">difference between a vaccine side effect and an adverse event</a>. Reports to VAERS help the CDC monitor the safety of vaccines. Safety is a top priority.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Healthcare providers are required to report certain adverse events following vaccination to VAERS. Healthcare providers also have to adhere to any revised safety reporting requirements according to FDA’s conditions of authorized use throughout the duration of any Emergency Use Authorization. These requirements would be posted on <a href="https://www.fda.gov/emergency-preparedness-and-response/mcm-legal-regulatory-and-policy-framework/emergency-use-authorization">FDA’s website.</a></p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">CDC is also implementing a new smartphone-based tool called <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/vsafe.html">v-safe</a> to check-in on people’s health after they receive a COVID-19 vaccine. When you receive your vaccine, you should also receive an information sheet telling you how to enroll in v-safe. If you enroll, you will receive regular text messages directing you to surveys where you can report any problems or adverse reactions you have after receiving a COVID-19 vaccine.</p>
