<p class="emphasized">COVID-19 vaccination is one of the most important tools to end the COVID-19 pandemic. The State is providing prioritization and allocation guidance to local health jurisdictions and health care providers so that the vaccine can be equitably distributed and administered at the community level to everyone in California who wants it. We expect to have enough supplies to vaccinate most Californians in all 58 counties by summer 2021.</p>

<h2 class="COVID-19 vaccines are here" id="COVID-19-vaccines-are-here">COVID-19 vaccines are here</h2>



<p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued <a href="https://www.fda.gov/emergency-preparedness-and-response/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19/covid-19-vaccines">Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for two COVID-19 vaccines</a>. More vaccines may be authorized early next year.</p>



<p>Learn more about FDA’s <a href="https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/vaccines/emergency-use-authorization-vaccines-explained">Emergency Use Authorization for Vaccines</a><strong> </strong>and watch a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGkwaESsGBQ">video on what an EUA is</a>.</p>



<h3>Vaccine safety is a top priority</h3>



<p>COVID-19 vaccines authorized by FDA have been shown to be safe and effective in clinical trials.</p>



<p>The U.S. vaccine safety system ensures that all vaccines are as safe as possible. Learn how the federal government is working to <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety.html">ensure the safety of COVID-19 vaccines</a>.</p>



<p>To ensure the COVID-19 vaccine meets safety requirements, California formed a <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/Scientific-Safety-Review-Workgroup.aspx">Scientific Safety Review Workgroup</a> to provide recommendations to California leadership and build public confidence in vaccines.</p>



<p>The Workgroup completed their concurrent and thorough review of the federal process and have confirmed that the COVID-19 vaccines authorized by FDA are safe and effective.</p>



<h2 id="Vaccine-allocation">Vaccine allocation</h2>



<p>Vaccine doses are <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/VaccineDoses.aspx">allocated</a> by the state to Local Health Jurisdictions (LHJs), large health systems, or state departments that span multiple counties.&nbsp;</p>



<p>California has also opted into the CDC’s <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/long-term-care/pharmacy-partnerships.html">Pharmacy Partnership for Long-Term Care (LTC) Program</a>. Under this program, CVS and Walgreens will administer the vaccine to residents and staff in long-term care facilities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Administered vaccine doses are <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/VaccineDoses.aspx">tracked</a> by the California Governor&#8217;s Office of Emergency Services (OES).</p>



<h2 class="Who gets vaccinated first" id="When-can-I-get-vaccinated">When can I get vaccinated?</h2>



<p>California is distributing and vaccination providers are administering the vaccine as it becomes available. California will be transparent, careful, and equitable in its vaccine distribution.</p>



<p>Initially vaccine supply will be very limited. At first, vaccines will be provided to healthcare workers and long-term care residents in accordance with the <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/CDPH-Allocation-Guidelines-for-COVID-19-Vaccine-During-Phase-1A-Recommendations.aspx">CDPH Allocation Guidelines</a>.</p>



<h3 id="California's-COVID-19-Vaccine-Plan">California&#8217;s COVID-19 Vaccine Plan</h3>



<p>After healthcare workers and long-term care residents,&nbsp; the next to be vaccinated will be individuals who have higher risk for severe disease or death (due to age or other factors), who are unable to work at home, who live or work in geographic areas that have been highly impacted, or who are most likely to spread disease to other workers or to the public.</p>



<p>These individuals will be prioritized as follows:</p>

<h3>How vaccine decisions are made</h3>



<p>Two groups work together to make sure vaccines are distributed fairly.</p>



<h4>Drafting Guidelines Workgroup</h4>



<p>A Drafting Guidelines Workgroup is developing California-specific guidance for the prioritization and allocation of vaccines when supplies are limited.</p>



<p>See CDPH’s Workgroup page for the vaccine&#8217;s phasing and resource materials.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/Drafting-Guidelines-Workgroup.aspx/" class="action-link pt-3 pb-3 px-4"><strong>View COVID-19 vaccination phases</strong></a></p></blockquote>



<h4>Community Vaccine Advisory Committee</h4>



<p>The Community Vaccine Advisory Committee is providing input and feedback to the planning efforts and resolving barriers to equitable vaccine implementation and decision-making.</p>



<p>See CDPH’s committee activities page for the upcoming meeting schedule and all meeting materials.</p>

<h2 id="How-COVID-19-vaccines-work">How COVID-19 vaccines work</h2>



<p>Vaccines help our immune system fight infections in the future. COVID-19 vaccines will protect us from the virus that causes COVID-19 without having to get the illness.</p>



<p>It typically takes a few weeks after the last dose in a series to become fully protected. Sometimes vaccination can cause mild fever or cold-like symptoms, but these are not harmful.</p>



<h2 id="Benefits-of-getting-vaccinated">Benefits of getting vaccinated</h2>



<p>COVID-19 vaccines are meant to prevent you from getting COVID-19 and from spreading it to others. The ability of COVID-19 vaccines to protect us from spreading the virus to others is not yet known, but is being studied carefully.</p>



<h2 id="Spread-the-news-about-COVID-19-vaccines">Spread the news about COVID-19 vaccines</h2>



<p>Share that vaccination against COVID-19 is here. Visit the <a href="https://toolkit.covid19.ca.gov/partners/#vaccinateall58">COVID-19 Response Toolkit</a> page to find images and videos you can post on social media.</p>



<h2 id="Questions-and-answers">Questions and answers</h2>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Who’s getting the vaccine now? Who is next to get it, and when?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">COVID-19 vaccines are currently available only for healthcare workers and residents of Long-Term Care Facilities (LTCFs) due to limited supplies.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">CVS and Walgreens are currently administering the free COVID-19 vaccine to residents and staff in LTCFs. They started at nursing homes, which will take an estimated 3-4 weeks, and then will vaccinate staff and residents in assisted living, residential care, and other long-term care facilities.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Next on the priority list for vaccination later this winter are:</p>



<ul class="wp-accordion-content"><li>Individuals 75 and older</li><li>Those at risk of exposure at work in the following sectors:&nbsp;<ul><li>Education</li><li>Childcare</li><li>Emergency services</li><li>Food and agriculture</li></ul></li></ul>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">How can I get the COVID-19 vaccination?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">If you are a healthcare worker, contact your employer. If you are a Long-Term Care Facilities (LTCF) resident, contact your caretaker.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">For LTCF residents and staff, CVS and Walgreen pharmacies will administer the vaccines. They will:</p>



<ul class="wp-accordion-content"><li>Schedule and coordinate on-site vaccine clinic dates directly with each facility. Pharmacy staff will visit each facility several times to ensure that all residents and employees who wish to be vaccinated get the vaccine.</li><li>Order vaccines and associated supplies (e.g. syringes, needles, personal protective equipment).</li><li>Ensure cold storage for the vaccine.</li><li>Provide on-site administration of the vaccine to all residents and staff.</li></ul>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">If you are a frontline essential worker or 75 years and older, contact your healthcare provider to see if they are enrolled to give the vaccine.&nbsp;</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">When can the general public, who are not <strong>otherwise</strong> in Phase 1, can start getting vaccinated?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Spring 2021 is the best estimate, but that may change. It depends on vaccine production and how quickly other vaccines become available.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Will I still need to wear a mask after getting a COVID-19 vaccine?&nbsp;</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Yes. How much protection the COVID-19 vaccines provide under real-life conditions is still unknown. It is important for everyone to continue using all the tools available to us to help stop this pandemic, like:</p>



<ul class="wp-accordion-content"><li><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/steps-when-sick.html"><strong>Staying home and isolating</strong></a><strong> from others when sick</strong></li><li>Wearing masks&nbsp;</li><li>Washing hands often</li><li>Social distancing</li></ul>



<p class="wp-accordion-content"> Together, COVID-19 vaccination and recommendations for <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/prevention.html">how to protect yourself and others</a> will offer the best protection from getting and spreading COVID-19. We need to understand more about the protection that COVID-19 vaccines provide before we change recommendations on mask use.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">How many COVID-19 vaccine doses are needed?</h4>



<ul class="wp-accordion-content"><li>Two doses for the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, 21 days apart.</li><li>Two doses for the Moderna vaccine, 28 days apart.</li></ul>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">How much will the COVID-19 vaccine cost?&nbsp;</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Nothing. COVID-19 vaccines, including their administration, are free.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Read more at the Department of Managed Health Care’s <a href="https://www.dmhc.ca.gov/Portals/0/Docs/DO/VaccineFactSheetAccessible.pdf">Know Your Health Care Rights</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Will the COVID-19 vaccine give me COVID-19?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">No. The COVID-19 vaccines do not contain coronavirus and cannot give you COVID-19.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Will the COVID-19 vaccine make me test positive for COVID-19?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">No. A vaccine will not cause you to test positive on <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/testing/diagnostic-testing.html">viral tests</a>.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">If your body develops an immune response (the goal of vaccination), there is a possibility that you may test positive on <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/testing/serology-overview.html">antibody tests</a>. Antibody tests indicate that you may have protection against the virus.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">I’ve already had COVID-19. Should I get a COVID-19 vaccine?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Yes. At this time, we do not know how long someone is protected from getting sick again after recovering from COVID-19.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Will you make the COVID-19 vaccine mandatory?&nbsp;</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">No, there is no mandatory vaccination requirement from either the state or federal government. While vaccine doses will be limited in supply at first, we hope that by educating Californians about the safety and efficacy of a COVID-19 vaccine, we can encourage voluntary adoption of the vaccine.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">How is my privacy protected if I take the COVID-19 vaccine?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">California law strictly limits how personal information about those who are vaccinated can be shared. California negotiated with the federal government to limit the required data sharing to only information that will not allow an individual to be identified.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Read more at CDPH’s <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/California-Data-Use-Agreement.aspx">California Data Use Agreement and Frequently Asked Questions</a>.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">I have allergies. Should I get the COVID-19 vaccine?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">It depends. <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/allergic-reaction.html">CDC recommends</a> that:</p>



<ul class="wp-accordion-content"><li>If you have ever had a severe allergic reaction to any ingredient in a COVID-19 vaccine, you should not get that specific vaccine.</li><li>If you have had a severe allergic reaction to other vaccines or injections, you should ask your doctor if you should get a COVID-19 vaccine.</li><li>People with a history of severe allergic reactions not related to vaccines or injections may still get vaccinated. People may get vaccinated even with a:<ul><li>History of allergies to oral medications</li><li>Family history of severe allergic reactions</li><li>Milder allergy to vaccines</li></ul></li><li>If you have a severe allergic reaction after getting the first shot, you should not get the second shot.</li></ul>
