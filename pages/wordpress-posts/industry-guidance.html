<p>California has a new <a href="http://covid19.ca.gov/safer-economy">Blueprint for Reducing COVID-19</a> in the state with revised criteria for loosening and tightening restrictions on activities. </p>



<p>Every county in California is assigned to a tier based on its rate of new cases and positivity. Check <a href="http://covid19.ca.gov/safer-economy">your county’s tier status</a> to see how businesses and activities can open.</p>



<h2>Reopen your business or facility safely</h2>



<p>Follow the <a href="https://files.covid19.ca.gov/pdf/employer-playbook-for-safe-reopening--en.pdf">Employer Playbook for a Safe Reopening</a> to help plan and prepare for reopening your business.</p>



<p>The playbook includes detailed information on:</p>



<ul><li>When and how an employer must report a COVID-19 positive employee.</li><li>What is defined as an outbreak.</li><li>Guidance for employers who may be considering whether to suspend operations due to COVID-19 spread in the workplace.</li></ul>



<p>Wearing a <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/masks-and-ppe/#top">mask or face covering</a> is required statewide in public or common spaces. Employers must provide face coverings to workers, or must reimburse workers for the reasonable cost of obtaining them. Find all requirements and exceptions to these rules in the guidance on this page below.</p>



<p>All businesses and facilities <strong>must </strong>follow the items listed here before reopening: </p>



<ol><li><strong>Scroll down this page to find the guidance for your industry, business, event, or activity.</strong></li><li>Review it completely.</li><li>Perform a detailed risk assessment and create a worksite-specific protection plan.</li><li>Train employees on how to limit the spread of COVID-19. This includes how to <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fsymptoms-testing%2Findex.html">screen themselves for symptoms</a> and when to stay home.</li><li>Set up individual control measures and screenings.</li><li>Put disinfection protocols in place.</li><li>Establish physical distancing guidelines. </li><li>Establish universal face covering requirements (with allowed exceptions). See <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/CDPH%20Document%20Library/COVID-19/Guidance-for-Face-Coverings_06-18-2020.pdf">CDPH guidelines (PDF)</a>.</li><li>Post your completed checklist so everyone can know the steps you’ve taken. Feel free to add more safety measures to the ones included in your industry’s guidance.</li></ol>



<h2>Employer policies and resources</h2>



<p>It’s important that employees with COVID-19 know they should stay home. Your sick leave policies need to support that. Workers also need safe and reliable childcare options during the COVID-19 response. See information on:</p>



<ul><li><a href="https://www.dir.ca.gov/dlse/Comparison-COVID-19-Paid-Leave.html">Government programs supporting COVID-19 sick leave</a> and <a href="https://www.labor.ca.gov/coronavirus2019/#chart">workers’ compensation</a></li><li><a href="https://files.covid19.ca.gov/pdf/guidance-family-friendly-practices-employers--en.pdf">Family friendly practices for employers (PDF)</a></li><li><a href="https://files.covid19.ca.gov/pdf/guidance-support-working-families--en.pdf">Support for working families (PDF)</a></li><li><a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/childcare/#top">Find childcare</a></li><li><a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/CDPH%20Document%20Library/COVID-19/Guidance-for-Face-Coverings_06-18-2020.pdf">CDPH guidance for the use of face coverings (PDF)</a></li></ul>
