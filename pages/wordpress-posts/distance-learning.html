        <p>The SJSU Lurie College of Education K-12 Online Teaching Academy was established in Summer 2020 in response to the inequities in learning exacerbated by the COVID-19 crisis and was intended to create free opportunities for pre-service teacher candidates and current teachers to strengthen their online skills. The 23 Summer 2020 webinar recordings feature a wide range of teachers, professors, and other practitioners who discuss how to build equity, employ emancipatory pedagogies, utilize a multitude of online platforms, and more. Lurie College is organizing additional webinars for January and February 2021.
