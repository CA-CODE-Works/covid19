<h4 class="wp-accordion">About the app</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">California COVID Notify quickly notifies you if you may have been exposed to COVID-19. You can then protect your friends and family, reducing the spread of infection in your community.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">The State of California is partnering with the University of California to test the app in a limited pilot. The results will determine whether the app will be used among all Californians.</p>
