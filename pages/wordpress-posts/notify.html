<h2>Exposure notification technology pilot</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://files.covid19.ca.gov/img/CACovidNotify.png" alt="California COVID Notify app logo"/></figure>



<p><em>California COVID Notify is currently only available as a pilot test to students, faculty and staff at the UC San Diego and UC San Francisco.</em><br><br>California Department of Public Health (CDPH) and Department of Technology (CDT) in partnership with the University of California are pilot testing <strong>California COVID Notify</strong> mobile app. The pilot will test the use of exposure notification technology through the California COVID Notify app. This privacy-preserving app has the capability to quickly notify users who may have been exposed to COVID-19 and reduce the risk of spreading infection in our communities. This pilot help us learn more about how exactly it works and its potential for helping us slow the spread of the virus to keep each other safe.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Currently, this app, is only available to students, faculty and staff at UC San Diego and UC San Francisco.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Through this pilot, CDPH and CDT will evaluate the technology and its implementation to determine whether to expand the use to all Californians to help us keep our communities safe.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The California COVID Notify app, which uses the Google Apple Exposure Notification technology, was selected because it was designed with privacy as a key consideration. See <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/notify-privacy/">Privacy Policy</a>.&nbsp; The app does not use location information or collect, store or transmit any personal information at any time. Use of the app is 100% voluntary.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3>How it works</h3>



<p><strong>California COVID Notify</strong>&nbsp;uses Bluetooth technology to quickly notify users who have likely been exposed to COVID-19. This helps you reduce the risk&nbsp;of infection&nbsp;for your friends and family and help California stop the spread.</p>



<p>California COVID Notify users will be asked to opt in to the notification system.</p>



<p>When you opt in and the Bluetooth is on, your smartphone will generate and transmit <strong>anonymous keys</strong> (long strings of random characters). These keys can&#8217;t be used to identify your location. Keys change every 10-20 minutes to further preserve your identity and privacy.</p>



<p>Whenever you carry your phone with you and are near other people, your phone and theirs will work in the background, <strong>exchanging these privacy-preserving anonymous keys</strong>. This is a passive process that begins once you opt in and functions without the app open. It does not drain your battery or use data.</p>



<p>Your phone will record the day that the anonymous keys were received, the duration of the signal, and the distance between the two phones (using Bluetooth signal strength as an approximation). These keys are stored on your phone for 14 days, then automatically deleted.</p>



<p>Several times a day, your phone downloads a list of all the anonymous keys associated with positive COVID-19 cases, and&nbsp;<strong>checks them against the list of anonymous keys it has encountered in the last 14 days</strong>.</p>



<p>If you have a matching key, the app runs a mathematical calculation developed by epidemiologists using the date, duration, and signal strength to assess your level of risk. You will be notified of an exposure only if the calculation meets the risk threshold. If you receive a notification, you will be directed to instructions on what to do next and<strong>&nbsp;how to keep yourself and the people around you safe.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>If you ever test positive for COVID-19, you can choose to share your anonymous keys with other app users to notify them of a possible exposure. Sharing this information helps others protect themselves and stops the virus from spreading.To do this you will get a verification code from a medical provider, lab, or public health contact tracer that will allow your anonymous keys to be uploaded to a server to activate notifications to other users. The verification code is required to ensure that only anonymous keys of someone with a verified positive test are shared.&nbsp; When the other users are notified, they will receive a message that they have had a possible exposure to COVID-19 and the date.&nbsp; The positive userâ€™s identity or phone number is not shared, but it possible that it could be guessed based on the exposure date.</p>
