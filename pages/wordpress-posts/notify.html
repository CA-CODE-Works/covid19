<h4 class="wp-accordion">About the app</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">California COVID Notify quickly notifies you if you may have been exposed to COVID-19. You can then protect your friends and family, reducing the spread of infection in your community.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">The State of California is partnering with the University of California to test the app in a limited pilot. The results will determine whether the app will be used among all Californians.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Thanks for your help in keeping our communities safe.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion" id="privacy">Your privacy is protected</h4>



<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>



<p class="wp-accordion-content"><strong>Effective as of September 21, 2020</strong></p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">This Privacy Policy describes how the California Department of Public Health protects the privacy of users installing the new exposure notification mobile application (app) – California COVID Notify. The policy explains how the data collected through the California COVID Notify app is stored and processed, and the choices available to the users in terms of app usage.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-accordion-content">About the California COVID Notify app</h3>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">The California COVID Notify exposure notification app allows users to send and receive notifications of a potential high-risk exposure to COVID-19, in a privacy-preserving manner. The notifications will include instructions on who to contact, and how to get tested.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The exposure notifications are intended to supplement the conventional contact tracing efforts undertaken by the state and local public health authorities involving contact by a caseworker.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-accordion-content">How it works    <strong> </strong></h3>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">The California COVID Notify app does not require the collection or exchange of any personal information, as defined in the California Information Practices Act, of the user to receive notifications.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">The mobile devices of the app users share anonymous keys (randomly generated strings of numbers) via Bluetooth. The only data collected by the app are the anonymous keys, Bluetooth signal strength, and date and duration of exposure. This information is not linked to a user’s identity or location. Each user&#8217;s keys change frequently to further protect their identity. The data is stored on the user’s mobile device for a period of 14 days and then automatically deleted. Once deleted the data cannot be restored.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">A user who tests positive for COVID-19, may choose to notify other California COVID Notify app users who may have had close contact with the user. To trigger such a notification, the COVID-19 positive must enter a valid PIN provided by the medical provider, lab, or local public health authority.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Several times a day, the app downloads a list of all the anonymous keys associated with positive COVID-19 cases and checks them against the list of keys it has encountered in the past 14 days. If there is a match, based on the date, duration, and Bluetooth signal attenuation (proximity indicator), it will indicate a possible exposure to the virus.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">The notification will inform the user of the date of exposure and instructions on who to contact and how to get tested.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-accordion-content">User consent &amp; choices</h3>



<h4 class="wp-accordion-content">Using the app</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">The app has the potential to limit infections and its use is highly encouraged. However, use of the California COVID Notify app is completely voluntary.</p>

<h4 class="wp-accordion-content">Disabling exposure notifications</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Users may disable California COVID Notify at any time by uninstalling the app or turning off the mobile device Bluetooth signals.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion-content">Generating exposure notifications to other users</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">A COVID-19 positive user may choose to notify other app users who may have come into contact with the user. Providing notification to other users is completely voluntary. The notification will not disclose the COVID-19 positive user’s identity, location or any personal information. A user may obtain a PIN from <strong>xxxx</strong>.</p>

It may be used in aggregate and anonymous form for statistical or scientific research purposes. This information will not include any personal or location information nor can it be used to identify any app user.</p>
